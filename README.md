# React component library template

Test React component library created by following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/XHQi5a0TmMc).

## Scripts

### `npm run build`

Builds the library to the `dist` directory, using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

### `npm run build:watch`

Same as `build`, but runs in watch mode. This means any change to the source files in `src` will trigger a rebuild.

### `npm test`

Runs all test in the project with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
